                <td align="left">In this hands-on builder session, we help you identify which cloud-native solutions can mitigate the same risks while providing scalability, reliability, and cost optimization at a low operational burden. During this workshop, you will learn how to use cloud native controls like CloudTrail, Security Groups, GuardDuty and many more, to secure your cloud architecture.

                <td align="left">Permission boundaries is probably one of the most important new IAM feature that has launched in awhile. This feature addresses a longstanding customer issue, namely, how do I delegate administration to my users. If you have developers that need to be able to create roles for Lambda functions, system administrators that need to be able to create IAM roles and users, or any similar scenario, then you need permission boundaries.
